# Deployment Plan for Fitness Project to GitHub

## Information Gathered
- The project is a static fitness tracker website consisting of `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and an `images` folder with various PNG/JPG files.
- The Git repository is already initialized in the current working directory (`c:/Users/lenovo/Desktop/fitness tracker`), on the `main` branch, and the remote origin is set to `https://github.com/Devanshtandon-ux/fit-forage.git`.
- All project files have been copied to the root directory and are currently untracked by Git.

## Plan
- [] Add all project files to the Git staging area.
- [] Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
- [] Push the commit to the `main` branch on GitHub.
- [] Enable GitHub Pages for the repository to deploy the static site.

## Dependent Files to be edited
- None (this is a deployment task, not code editing).

## Followup Steps
- [] After pushing, go to the GitHub repository settings, navigate to Pages, set the source to the `main` branch, and save to enable deployment.
- [] The site will be live at `https://devanshtandon-ux.github.io/fit-forage/` once Pages is enabled.
